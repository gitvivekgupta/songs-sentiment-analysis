'Cause lately I've been waking up alone, Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt,
Told you I'd let them go,
And that I'll fight my corner, Maybe tonight I'll call ya, After my blood turns into alcohol,
No, I just wanna hold ya.

Give a little time to me or burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,

My, my, my, my, oh give me love,

Give me love like never before,
'Cause lately I've been craving more,
And it's been a while but I still feel the same, Maybe I should let you go,
You know I'll fight my corner,
And that tonight I'll call ya, After my blood is drowning in alcohol,
No I just wanna hold ya.

Of all the money that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company 
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of width 
To memory now I can't recall 
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that ever I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that ever I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

A man may drink and not be drunk 
A man may fight and not be slain 
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again 
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all"

I hear the people walk by when it's late Sirens bleed through my windowsill I can't close my eyes
Can't control what I'm into
This tower is alive The lights that blind keep me awake With my hood up and lace untied Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into
 London calls me a stranger A traveler This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

The pavement is my friend And it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road Fulfills my needs and gives me company When I need it Voices speak through my walls I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow  London calls me a stranger A traveler This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts But I need to move along  London calls me a stranger This is not my home, home
I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two"

On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe leave back there 
I'm sat here wishing I was sober 
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating  Without you to hold I'll be freezing 
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing  Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me
 Should I, should I? Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands 
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend 
So shall we speak then
Keep it between friends Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
 There maybe other people like us
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before 
You don't hold me anymore 

On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake 
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape 
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
 Should I, should I? Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself 
I'm here again 
All by myself 
You know I'll never change
All by myself 
All by myself 
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love"

Left to the hands of the coroner,

I see it in your movements tonight,
If we can ever do this right,
I'm never gonna let you down,
Oh I'll never let you down,
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know,
That I'll never let you down,
I'll never let you down.

Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground And never ever let you down,
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground And never ever let you down

This drink is a liver killer,
My chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest again,
Your body is my ballpoint pen

And your mind is my new best friend,
Your eyes are my mirror to take me to the edge again,
Now I see it in your movements tonight,

The only evidence that you've been here before 
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore 
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes Never getting dry so I get high smoke in the day then I sleep with the light on Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk by the end of the night 
I don't drink like everybody else
End up forgetting things about myself
I'm stubborn I'm forward head's just blocked 
My head's still with you but my hearts just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
That's why you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
 Everybody said that we'll be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down come around break up the love like Lego now Never wanna turn into another like you Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views 
Everything's great but everything's short 
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
And every thing I say seems to always sound awkward 
Like our last kiss it was perfect but we were nervous 
On the surface 
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative 
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
Oh you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied
 Because if I was gonna go somewhere I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down oh
And thinking I am unaware I keep my feet on the ground 
Keep looking around to make sure I'm not he only one to feel low Because if you want I'll take you in my arms
And keep you sheltered from all that I've done wrong 
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know that god made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I ended over U-N-I

With your name
And take my passport out again And just replace it

See I could do without a tan
On my left hand, where my fourth finger meets my knuckle And I should run you a hot bath
And fill it up with bubbles 
'Cause maybe you're lovable And maybe you're my snowflake And your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter I'll
Hold you in a cold place And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder 
And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty If you did the same to me Would you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek 'Cause we've watched it twelve times
But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too
And if your DVD breaks, today You shoulda got a VCR 'Cause I never owned a Blu-Ray
True say

And now I've always been s*** at computer games and your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go all cross And chuck all the controllers at the TV And then you'd laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you'd lie with me till I fall asleep And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets 
And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

I think you hate the smell of smoke You always tryna get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot

So I'll take you to the beach And walk along the sand And I'll
Make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand

And I'll carve it like a necklace So the heart falls where your chest is
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe To feel my heart against yours now Against yours now

'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up"

I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you at all
You need me man, I don't need you

You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you at all

I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verso 
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing 
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School 
I came fast with the way I act, right 
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre 
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia 
And musically I'm demonstrating 
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating  Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi'

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right 
I won't stop till my name's in light 
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on arabian nights Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice 
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper 
 Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level  Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal 
 People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch 
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow)

From day one, I've been prepared 
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic  Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift 
Into another rappers shoes using new laces  Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers  Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors  Nationwide til' we're just jack, soon as I get the bus back
 Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache 
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a French church tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though  According to the myspace and youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio  Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio  Melody music maker  Reading all the papers 
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator 

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you"

Pain ain’t the emotion I wanna feel but I’m thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic 
I’ll be on a hill, keeping my head above water
I can’t afford to ever get caught in a corner 
So I move with the force of a sorcerer 
It’s dark when I’m about just me myself and my shadow 
I'm parro, running out of ammo, and it seems like everyone around me is on the same path so it’s narrow 
The less then the better, a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella 
I play fool to catch wise are they ever gonna guess I'm clever 
How can I be at my best with this pressure 
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mind’s infected with terror 
No wonder I’m under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence 
It easy when you look back, shoulda, woulda, coulda but I bet you can’t bring should woulda could back
Back to fifteen I said to myself, that I’m more than a hood track!

You can’t ever drown me out, the water supplies too low
And I'm around about 6'1, 10 stone 
I've never seen someone drown without, a sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
A violent MC, my mouth can vouch 
Do I sound like I’m choking? Seriously, do I sound like I’m joking?
I’m floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean 
But I am a ship that's sunk many years, I’m maintaining  Plain sailing, no commotion 
Like a dolphin, when it’s in motion 
But i can't break me, so why would I show them I’m broken 
No real shit, throw my skin ain’t close to corrosion 
Fuck em all, this ain't tug of war, still don't get roped in the open, I don’t wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign
Then I’ma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye
Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you don’t wanna see this guy survive.

To see my family. Please Father let me go,
As my mother sleeps.

I don't know about days gone,
But round here nobody lives twice.
When your gone, your gone, without no bye, Cause only a judge can give you life.
This is my advice, Trust me, I nearly lost my life.
3 weeks after I got this ride
It seems like I had too much wine. Which that I I didn't get one,
Anyway, I was going to the [?] booked for a set,
Even though I didn't have a set one. Skream hit the decks, I was like check one.
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one.
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination,
Then I was off to the next one,
20 minutes later I was on the M1,
Tired.
But I kept on going,
Fell asleep without even knowing.
No emotion in my face,
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going.
Woke up,
Lorry,
Flash,
Panic,
Break,
Skid,
Crash,
Skidded,
More,
Bang,
Smash,
Out,
Cold,
Ribs,
Cracked,
Ouch.
I was in so much pain, Crawled out of a Megane that now looked like a Mini,
When I was still on the first lane.
Baffled, didn't even know my name.
Fainted, too much shock in my brain. Surrounded by paramedics and feds, Trying to get up but fainted again.

See I just want you to take a second, hear me out.
Don't think I'm happy cause I smile when you see me out.
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared,
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,
To see my family,
And keep it inside,
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps.
Save my soul, Please Father let me go.
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps.

Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open,
I can hear voices and my phone ringing. Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning,
One of the worst situations I've been in.
I can hear all of the angels singing.

But when it stopped humming,
My brain turned on, stared running. Still in pain, but it started numbing,
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning.
I still tried to do a few shows cause I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming.
But I was left with a permanent problem, Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (inside).
Ever so cunning,
6 weeks later, jogging and running.
I used the first aid kit like a drum set, Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming. Trust me, when it comes to mistakes,
You can't afford to let one in. Never done dream for a while,
The pipeline was blocked,
So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing.
They say tomorrow never dies,
But he forgot to tell you 'you can'.
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang,
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam.
You can try beg for another, Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show, Thinking 'I just wanna see my brother',
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, Runner.

I just want you to take a second, hear me out.
Don't think I'm happy cause I smile when you see me out.
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared.
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,
To see my family.
And keep it inside,

Can you hear me?
I just wanted to let you know
Hm

I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam'
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels 
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving 
They said they were gold in the pavements 
But you came and saw the road to amazement  Broke your heart 
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright 
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache 
You just got on with it Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful 
And your words you would stand strong with it
'Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you.

And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never want to be alone 

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you, oh

I think you phoney 
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me Instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out?' Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths 
I miss seeing a family, being a family 
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child 
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer  Family problems have never been funny 
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia 
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces 
I never forgive the way she betrayed us. There ain't a big enough reason Before I sell out my fam' I'll be giving up breathing 
But I guess that everyone's different 
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing. Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect 
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you.

And of the pieces of my soul

And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you, oh

It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you, when I see you but,
I miss you
Ohh how I miss you
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you
Ohh how I miss you
 There ain't enough words to describe 
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused  Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood 
We were young and he said it was raping his broad 
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth  Stealing from your purse and making you mourn 
I never been able to say this before 
'Cause I was so inconsiderate 
You loved me unconditionally 
And I took advantage of it like a idiot.
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment 
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me.

I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?

Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep  Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables 
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme 
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
""'Cause real will recognize real"" is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close.

Five o'clock with lights off Interview with a vampire  Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require 
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed, it's D-E-V to the Z
Overtired, pale-faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired 
And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying 
'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
It's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight 
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes,
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by

I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be...
The times I'm living in lately.

I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth 
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron
But they won't Slytherin too easy, believe me I'm Snape minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows 
Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro, living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework  Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie Await death, take deep breaths, try to never die. Never die.

Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws  Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes 
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze, Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most Practical to do, Driven young gentlemen 
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them, true!
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment  Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got,
I keep my pupils engaged,
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake.

[Chorus]
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be... [x4]
The times I'm living in lately."

And I vowed that my breathing with never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon screen?
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week, Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife, Right now it's better than it's never been Never fade like a plant that's evergreen 
So I hope to my heart, but my self doubts are getting me, Afraid for my cross, getting dump for the day and I'm getting weak, Cause I'm new, I'm that boy that starts it.
They chase dreams together like a slumber party,
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmare is fading.

When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.

You better wake up cause I am making moves,
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rooms,
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training,
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze.
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading,
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her
Now I'm taking control of my inception, cause they try to hit misses with my direction,
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike,
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry, I'm awake at night,
The haters know where the family lives,
Tell me what I catch, but you're playing knock door ginger.
Just gonna lose a lot more, than I need it.
They say sleep is the cause of death,
But I hear shit because I am deaf
Gang signs I'm N/A reading.
I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next.

I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.
They watching me! They watch me sleep!

Let me go!
I fell asleep on sofa, walk up in reality,
And daydream about losing my sanity.
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow.
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed.
But to achieve the dreams you can't doze off cos your dream a sleep 
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat.
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep.
See, all the dreams I'm fonder,
You placed me in the team insomnia 
Now, I Mr hard worker,
In my nightmares I Mr can't turn up,
And I missed my chance worst luck, Trying to hit women I Mr I turn up
Yeah, and I walked from ish, thinking it will put me to rest on my mattress

When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.

My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you

But it won't hold me like you do

But I do it for the love, Waiting on the gold rush

And remember the time
When we were in school, listening to grown ups
Didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything other than that

And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?

If we take a walk out, in the morning dew,
We can lie down, so I'm next to you,
Come inside for a little home made tea,
And if you fall asleep, at least you're next to me,
And if I wake up, say it's late love, go back to sleep,
I'm covered by nature, and I'm safe now, Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me.

You make me scream, then I made you cry,
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die.

'Cause in a pipe she flies to the Motherland 
And sells love to another man
It's too cold outside 
For angels to fly Angels to fly

Dry house, wet clothes  Loose change, bank notes 
Weary-eyed, dry throat 
Call girl, no phone

That left us on the floor 
And you breathe me

I'll make it disappear, dear

Darling, don't be nervous

I'll stop eating food

So I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness 
And why you're leaving too
Maybe, I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

That left my skin dark red
You squeeze me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated 
I'll give up and be frustrated 
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been hated 
This love's too overrated 
See what's going on, on

Take me back to Albert Road

And we’re wrapped in light, in life, in love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they’re designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we’re set alight, we’re afire love, love, love oh

And things were all good yesterday Then the devil took your breath away
And now we’re left here in the pain Black suit, black tie standin' in the rain
And now my family is one again Stapled together with the strangers and a friend Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
Six years old I remember when

She said don't you worry if I disappear 
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right 
I went away for months until our paths crossed again 
She told me I was never looking for a friend  Maybe you can swing by my room around ten
Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
Well be in between the sheets 'till the late AM 
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
She's singing 

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe

For a couple of weeks I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza  Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature 
And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either 
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what its about  Maybe well go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch 
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out
Why I'm sat here singing 

Don't  with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder 
I already told you Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat  Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course 
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment 
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different 
This is not the way you realize that you want it
It's a bit too much too late if I'm honest 
And all this time God knows I'm singing 

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows 
Take aim and reload 
I don't wanna know that babe"

Late last night  Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can’t shake this feeling now

And oh, I’ve only caused you pain, you know
With all of my words, always beloved

Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me cause I write the truth No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject I love it
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually You're practically my family If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no Anymore I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no Anymore  Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery I'm not cut out for life on the road Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry That's when I broke your heart I was supposed to chart and celebrate But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no Anymore I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no Anymore 
And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could The irony is if my career and music didn't exist In six years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm twenty seven, I'll die from a thrill Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty But I had to get this off my chest 
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no Anymore I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore"

But then you were one as well
And I could play the guitar 
Just like ringing the bells  Sometimes I wonder 
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover 
To me listening to Stevie Wonder Under the covers where we used to lay
And read stacks while the speakers play
I’ll be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed Getting high, two cars, we needed to breathe 
We used each other’s edge just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep 
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And also you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry about your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time’s the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'mma wait too much Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane 
Or make a mistake, say it again 

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain’t never coming home
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
'Cause that’s you and me
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter 
You’d be wearing my hood
With jewels, strings pulled tight 
To keep your face in the cold Taking day trips to the local  Where we D on the road
'Cause every day when I was a baby
Don’t you speak on the phone  Watching Blue Planet  Creating new habits 
And if we were two rabbits 
And then you'd vanish 
Back to burrow all of the ‘queltics’ are disappearing 
You call me selfish, I don’t understand 
But I can’t help it
I put my trouble for everything  Except my family and friends 
But you’ll be in between forever
So I guess we’ll have to take a step back Overlook the situation 
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications 
And I’m not saying we should be taking a break 
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain
Or wait to get on the plane 
But in the day we’ll have to say it again 

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain’t never coming home
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
'Cause that’s you and me
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won’t you leave me now People grow, and fall apart 
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, oh won’t you leave me now

Oh Nina (Love will come and love will go)
You should go Nina (But you can make it on your own)
'Cause I ain’t never coming home (Sing that song, go)
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina (People grow, and fall apart)
And then again you should know Nina (But you can mend your broken heart)
'Cause that’s you and me (Take it back)

You should go Nina (But you can make it on your own)

And time's forever frozen still 

So you can keep me Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier  Remember that with every piece of you

That's okay baby, only words bleed Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen 
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

Well, that's okay baby, only words bleed Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

I’ve never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone, and the kitchen lie
I tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet 
And this is what I’m gonna do Gonna runaway, gonna make that move Gonna grab clothes, and when it’s morning, go

'Cause I packed my clothes 
My dad wasn’t in with that plan too bit tired and turns to show up
I don’t wanna live this way Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days Could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us the same
To get the good nose up
I don’t wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase 
Tie both shoelaces, and hold that Things change, but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

I’ve been sat with you
For most of the night Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don’t wanna know
If you’re getting ahead of the program I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close Take another step into the no-man’s land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling Come on set the tone
If you feel you’re falling Won’t you let me know, oh

Louder, oh oh
Sing, oh oh

This love is a blaze I saw flames from the side of the stage And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke Let it go until I wrote a change singing we found love in a local raid, no
I don’t really know what I’m supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told them my name and said it’s nice to meet ya
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila I already know she’s a keeper Just from this one small act of kindness, I’m in deep
If anybody finds out I’m meant to drive home
But I’m drunk and gonna live it now no?
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another now she’s kissing my mouth 
I need you darling Come on set the tone
If you feel you’re falling Won’t you let me know, oh

If you love me come on get involved Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe, oh

Sing, oh oh

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don’t really wanna dance Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it? Found you hiding here so hoped you'd take my hand, darling Before the beats kicks in again Can you feel it, oh
Can you feel it, oh no no no?

(Sing) I need you darling Come on set the tone
If you feel you’re falling Won’t you let me know (louder), oh

Down your shoulders and back

As if no one knows anything but us

I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

You look so beautiful in this light Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea

They just fade out when you take a breath Just say the word and I will disappear Into the wilderness

On the radio beat
They're playing 'Chasing Cars'

Back to the time,
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp lit streets I knew Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars?
Over Amsterdam 
You're the song my heart is Beating to

Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls 
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke 
Keep watching over Durin's son

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together  Watch the flames climb high into the night  Calling out for the rope, sent by and we will Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side hey

Then we should all die together  Raise a glass of wine for the last time Calling out for the rope Prepare as we will Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky

I see fire, burning the trees 
And I see fire, hollowing souls
And I see fire, blood in the breeze 
And I hope that you'll remember me

Oh, should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame  Calling out father hold fast and we will Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky

I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground 
I hear my people screaming out

And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of Anchored down in the throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves Under your eyes These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves Under your eyes

I've got a habit of spitting  Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens 
Out of the pages they sit in
And never once I get bitten  Because plagiarism is hidden  Which I would sit on the rhythm  Prisoner with a vision  Signs of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism  Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen  Studio is a system 
And you could say that I'm driven 
And now it's on to the next saga
We drink the best lager 
I never tried to win you over
Like your stepfather 
I do my own thing now, and get respect after
And I'm avoiding cocaine like it was Get Carter 
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight 
At sixteen years old, yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked 
And went from sleeping at the subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population 
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I'll take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

I take it back with the rhythm and blues 
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news Trying to act like Jack Black when I bring 'em to school 
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit 
They try and take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot 
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm Whispering everything that happens is from now on
I'll be ready to start again at the end of the song Still their claiming that I handled it wrong 
But then I never had an enemy, except for NME 
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
I'm healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree  Singing for the masses  Rubber dinghy rapids 
Keep this rapping a habit 
And keep on passioning magic
I'm battling for respect 
I don't know if I'll have it
This songs from the heart  Cover the planet 
I'll take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Take it back now
Now I don't ever want to be perfect  Cause I'm a singer that you Never want to see shirtless 
And I accept the fact that someone has to win worst-dressed Taking my first steps into the scene  Giving me focus  Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton Considering a name change  Thinking it was hopeless  Rhyming over recordings  Avoiding tradition Cause every day some lyrics 
And a melody can be written 
Now absence can make your heart break
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly 
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again  Living life on the edge
With a closed hand full of friends 
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally  Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally 
It might seem totally impossible Achieving life's dreams 
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely 
You'll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates  Having a pint with McDaid  Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised  Remembering our background 
Sat down
That's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No"

I'd tell you that it's simple 
And it was only ever thus  There is nowhere else that I belong 

Come on come out come here come here

Come on come out come here come here

Come on come out come here come here

Come on come out come here come here

The lone neon lights 
And the want of the ocean 
And the fire that had started to spark 
I miss it all from the love to the lightning 
And the lack of it snaps me in two

Just give me a sign  There is end in a beginning 
Til the quiet chaos driving me mad 
The lone neon lights 
And the want of the ocean 
And the fire that had started to go out"

Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain

In my phone are several texts from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seems and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon  Looking around for the things that I left on the ground 
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind 
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride 
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive 
And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride 
You know that I've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs 
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become 
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree 
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry 
Show me the locked doors, I find another use of key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher  Another one to take the sting away

Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain Eraser 

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs 
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong 
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well

I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become 
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans  Wembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud 
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed 
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now Somehow

Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?

As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write  About a Galway girl and a perfect night

You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Louis Lane, I wasn't Superman 
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved 
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse  Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas  Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime 
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says, chune, boy never light up the room
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisp, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone 
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone 
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved 
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently 
When you're with him, I know you're lonely  Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave 
Don't call me up, you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about 
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about

She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home

To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time

Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

I gave away my money and now we don't even speak 
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly? Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels 
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf 
No farewell 
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself 

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or dream 
What line do we stand upon 'cause from here looks the same?
And only scars remain

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels 
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf 
No farewell 
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself 

But if don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger 
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again  Between the devil and the danger 
But I guess it's just my nature 
My dad was wrong 
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps 
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself 

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels 
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf

I know when I have children they will know what it means 
And I pass on these things my family's given to me

The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans 
It's love and understanding, positivity

81,?? [2017],Ed Sheeran,Supermarket Flowers,3:41,/lyric/33797275/Ed+Sheeran/Supermarket+Flowers,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33797275/Ed+Sheeran/Supermarket+Flowers,"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill 
I threw the day old tea from the cup Packed up the photo album Matthew had made Memories of a life that's been loved 
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink 

Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved 

So I'll sing Hallelujah 
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah 
You're home

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek 
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived 

So I'll sing Hallelujah 
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah 
You're home
 Hallelujah 
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person that I have become  Spread your wing
And I know that when God took you back he said Hallelujah 
You're home"
