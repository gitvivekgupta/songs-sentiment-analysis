Oh yeah
So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I will never send Sometimes these cuts are so much Deeper then they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them bleed 
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery  There ain't nobody 
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back Gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be Completely intertwined
It's not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel,
It's what I didn't show
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery  There ain't nobody 
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back Gonna get you back

You say your faith is shaken 
You may be mistaken 
You keep me wide awake and Waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused 
So far away from you
I'm getting there
Don't care where I have to run

Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah

I am in misery  There ain't nobody 
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back Gonna get you back

Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back Gonna get you back

I'm standing right behind you
The streets are much colder 
This mean I'm getting older

Why would you? How could I? These questions lead to goodbye 
But now I got my freedom 
Don't I?

[Chorus]
I parked my car outside your house 
Hope that someday you'll come home Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I've finally found a way to be alone 
I'm terrified, I think that I may be losing my mind

Shy girl, so humble 
With eyes that make me stumble  Somehow not speaking lets me know everything 
I go out, you eat in
Hide from the situation 
You're naked in daylight 
Wrap yourself up and goodnight 

I'm burning, I'm hungry  Angry 'cause she don't love me
You've got me completely 
In my own game, you beat me

[Chorus]

I will be back again 
No this is not the end
I've fallen hard this time but I not giving in
I want the world to know that I won't let you forget 
The tears that you shed
I'll make it impossible to let go

[Chorus: x2]"

Our road is long
Your hold is strong Please don't ever let it go, oh no

I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad Everyone has a secret Oh, can they keep it
Oh, no they can't
 Driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow Where you at now
I feel around There you are

Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you, how hot can it get?
As you wipe off beads of sweat Slowly, you say, I'm not there yet

You knock me down Provoke a smile And make me frown You are the queen of runaround You know it's true

You chew me up
And spit me out Enjoy the taste I leave in your mouth You look at me
I look at you Neither of us know what to do
 There may not
Be another way to your heart So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when i hear your name Think about you but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin
 Immobilized by the thought of you Paralyzed by the sight of you Hypnotized by the words you say
Not true but I believe 'em anyway 
So come to bed it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste Remember how my body tastes You feel you heart being to race"

And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday Worth all of the pain that I have gone through And Mama I've been cryin' Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun.""
 Moving on down my street I see people I won't ever meet Think of her, take a breath Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps 
And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday Worth all of the pain that I have gone through And Mama I've been cryin' Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun.""

The rhythm of her conversation The perfection of her creation The sex she slipped into my coffee The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on

But I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday Worth all of the pain that I have gone through And Mama I've been cryin' Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun."""

As far as an eternity  Outstretched arms, open hearts 
And if it never ends then when do we start?
I'll never leave you behind 
Or treat you unkind 
I know you understand 
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive 
 Pushing forward and arching back Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have some things to say

How does it feel to know you never have to be alone 
When you get home There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I
 Dream away everyday 
Try so hard to disregard 
The rhythm of the rain that drops 
And coincides with the beating of my heart 

I'll never leave you behind 
Or treat you unkind

And I don't know if it'll ever be okay to show

To see if I'm gone
'Cause I fear
 There is nothing left to say to you
That you want to hear
That you want to know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful 
You're just an innocent A helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect Going after anything that I can get
So you'd better turn your head and run
And don't look back Cause I fear
 There is nothing left to say to you
That you want to hear
That you want to know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful 
And I have done you so wrong Treated you bad Strung you along Oh, shame on myself I don't know how I got so tangled up

She said goodbye too many times before

I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore, woah, woah, woah

Keep her coming every night 
So hard to keep her satisfied

And make sure everything is alright 
My pressure on your hips Sinking my fingertips 
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me

As you lay in bed Thinking about everything That you did not do Cause saying I love you
Has nothing to do with meaning it

And I don't trust you Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Do you remember The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you Cause I remember very well

And how long has it been Since someone you let in
Has given when I gave to you

And at night when you sleep Do you dream I would be there Just for a minute or two
Do you

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Heartache, heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you"

How ya feelin'?
The day has had its way with both of us
And no, I've gone out of my way
But I'm not free
From this pain I'm reelin'
I was a fool to think some day you would come around 
But no no no I'm not thinking that way
'Cause now I see

You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me Sometimes I just wanna scream

I think you should just go away cause 
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way Forget it baby your not comin' in

How's your day been?
'Cause mine has taken strange and ugly turns 
But no no no I feel better today
'Cause I'm off my knees 

You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me Sometimes I just wanna scream

I think you should just go away cause 
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way Forget it baby your not comin' in

A heart made for a lot of sorrow 
No you can't come back tomorrow 
Shut my windows, lock my doors 
'Cause my heart won't be your rag doll anymore

You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave 
 Fingers trace your every outline Paint a picture with my hands 
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm  Change the weather, still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave 

But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you.
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me Driving slow on Sunday morning Driving slow

It's flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair"

The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane  Never to return again
But always in my heart 

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore, woah, woah, woah

I tried my best to feed her appetite 
Keep her coming every night 
So hard to keep her satisfied 
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

But, oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore woah, woah, woah

I'll fix these broken things  Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything is alright 
My pressure on your hips Sinking my fingertips 
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me

Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

In my head it all feels the same

Like the taste of the day you left
It still lingers on my breath And the dampness of tears that left
The stain where you had wept

All alone with the negligee That still hangs off of my bed
I keep meaning to give it away
But I just leave it there instead

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me Every time I wind up back at your door
 Three more days till I see your face
I'm afraid it's far too much
Cook a meal and fix up the place Dial your number, hang it up

If I took you for granted I apologize for acting tough
You're my reason for living And there's no way I'm giving up, oh

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me Every time I wind up back at your door

Now, every evening is a bitter fight
And I'm eating home alone on a Friday night
And I know what your friends say
""He's just wasting your love and time.""
I will never let you change your mind

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me Every time I wind up back at your door

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?

I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
 Please don't leave, stay in bed Touch my body instead Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it? Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

Oh my, I don't mind being the other guy
Nice try, for these games I do not have the time
If you want me, call me
Come and take a risk kiss Leave somewhere deep under the surface 
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
 Please don't leave, stay in bed Touch my body instead Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it? Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it? Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it? Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?"

I get behind; make your move Forget about the truth

I've been here before 
One day I'll wake up
And it won't hurt anymore 
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi 
The words you say don't have a meaning 
'Cause...

You don't cry, and you don't care Afraid to have a love affair Is that your ghost or are you really there?

Now, I can't walk
I can't talk anymore since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
 Weather on a sunny day
Time slows down; I wish you'd stay
Pass me by in crowded, dark hallways Mmm

I try my hardest not to scream I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink

Now, I can't walk
I can't talk anymore since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

I heard you say you needed me now
What's the problem? I can't see
You destroyed me; I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart

Take what you wanted I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night Waiting and falling Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?

Now, I can't walk
I can't talk anymore since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

I heard you say you needed me now
What's the problem? I can't see
You destroyed me; I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart

We must free up these tired souls Before the sadness kills us both

I tried and tried to let you know
I love you, but I'm letting go
It may not last, but I don't know
I just don't know

If you don't know
Then you can't care
And you show up
But you're not there But I'm waiting And you want to Still afraid that I will desert you
 Everyday With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever; but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

A bed that's warm with memories Can heal us temporarily The misbehaving only makes The ditch between us so damn deep
 Built a wall around my heart I'll never let it fall apart But, strangely, I wish secretly It would fall down while I'm asleep 
If you don't know
Then you can't care
And you show up
But you're not there But I'm waiting And you want to Still afraid that I will desert you, babe
 Everyday With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever; but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way
 Though we have not hit the ground It doesn't mean we're not still falling, oh
I want so bad to pick you up
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
What a shame; I hope you find somewhere to place the blame But until then the fact remains...
 Everyday With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever; but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way
 Everyday With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever; but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way"

And after all this time
I've finally found a way to be alone I'm terrified, I think that I may be losing my mind

Shy girl, so humble With eyes that make me stumble Somehow not speaking lets me know everything I go out, you eat in
Hide from the situation You're naked in daylight Wrap yourself up and goodnight 
I'm burning, I'm hungry Angry 'cause she don't love me
You've got me completely In my own game, you beat me

So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true
It comes true

Have you learned all the secrets yet?
Will you burn by the things I've said?
Took the dive just to feel alive But never heard the truth 
Now I'm in love but I don't know how
I'm in pain cause I want it now
As I sit watching her eyes close I slowly open mine

And be near
Just for the moment Stay here Never go home

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true, comes true

I am so confused by this
I know that life is hit or miss
Days are stung by too much sun
I think that you may be the one
 Cover yourself up in me Shrouded in what could have been
I will listen to your pain
If you listen to me

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, as the story of a broken heart comes true,
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?

Hard to believe that

Just give me one more chance to make it right 
I may not make it through the night 
I won't go home without you

The taste of her breath 
I'll never get over
The noises that you made kept me awake

I should not ever let you go, oh, oh, oh

One more time tonight You can tell by the lines in her smile Something is not right  Where are you hiding (hiding)

Just another crazy boy Hungry for your

Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove The emptiness leaves me and I'm Filled up Never need to
Go back to the way I was
The way I was

I tried and tried and tried and tried But I have no concept of consequence And I'm a master of self defense Days get longer Life gets shorter She rips me like no other So oh dripping from head to toe
 Where are you hiding (hiding)
She's on the outside I'm on the inside crying (crying)

Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove The emptiness leaves me and I'm Filled up Never need to

Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove The emptiness leaves me and I'm Filled up Never need to
Go back to the way I was
The way I was

I can't make the same mistake If you lose my love
It was yours to take Break down your door
Take a little more
When I need you around 
And I'm so terrified of leaving It's a new low
Try and pick me up again but
Let go see how far I get without you Desperately need more of your

Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a

A pretty little girl I left behind And now you're getting rough
But everybody knows you're not that tough

You're scared to death of the road ahead Pretty little thing don't get upset

And I never thought about you much
Till I'm broken down and all alone 
No I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying, oh

Took you for granted When you lifted me up

I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell Afraid nothing can save me
But the sound of your voice 
You cut out all the noise And now that I can see mistakes so clearly, now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how?
But how?

I can feel it in my guts
What's going on with him now

Don't patronize me with lies
I'ma man, be a woman now

I have been bound by the shackles of love
And I don't mind if I die tied up

Took you for granted When you lifted me up

I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell Afraid nothing can save me
But the sound of your voice 
You cut out all the noise And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how?
But how?
But how?
But how?

Why must we be so ugly
And please do not speak ill of me
Why does the one you love Become the one who makes you want to cry

And why?
Why?
Why?

No I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying I do not mind if I die trying I do not mind if I die trying"

On my fingers and toes but I'm running out Clever words can't help me now
I grip you tight but you're slipping out

And I remember your eyes were so bright When I first I met you, so in love that night And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry Beautiful goodbye, bye bye, bye bye
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),
Your beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah

When did the rain become a storm When did the clouds begin to form
Yeah we got knocked off course by a natural force
And well, we'll be swimming when it's gone

And I remember your eyes were so bright When I first I met you, so in love that night And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry Beautiful goodbye, bye bye, bye bye
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),
Your beautiful goodbye whoa (bye bye, bye bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah

All the pain you try to hide Shows through your mascara lines as they stream down from your eyes
And let 'em go, let 'em fly Holding back won't turn back time Believe me, I've tried 
Your eyes were so bright And I remember your eyes were so bright I remember your eyes were so bright When I first I met you, how in love were we that night And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry Beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah

And sit on top of me, yelling out my fucking name Until I'm empty And I know she wants me

Whoa, whoa, yeah yeah yeah yeah

And I'll see you when I get back Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax You know you want me

All the time and everywhere A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And the emptiness is too much to bear

I'm standing, standing right in front of you
And pray our pain subsides Can't bare the stare of your teary eyes

In fact you may just wanna run away
Now all that I can really say is baby, oh
Deep down you know that

If you don't want this, then what's the use? Sleeping up under the covers 
How am I so far away from you?

Distant, when we're kissing 
Feel so different 
Baby tell me how did you get so

Cold enough to chill my bones 
It feels like I don't know you anymore 
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe 
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So cold, its a cold world 
Whoa, yeah
So cold, its a cold world 
Whoa, yeah
So cold, its a cold world 
I don't understand why you're so cold
 Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless 
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier 
Now you tryna' cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna' stay, and I leave  Saying that you need some time to breathe  Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep 
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, but the way your heart used to be
You gold dig every day
I switched the four door to the two door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space 
Baby, tell me how did you get so

Cold enough to chill my bones 
It feels like I don't know you anymore 
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe 
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

So cold, its a cold world 
Whoa, yeah

Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side Every mornin' I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time mmm
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye 
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time

I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember oh
 Leaves are fallin', it's September 
The night came in and made her shiver 
I told her she could have my jacket  Wrapped it tight around her shoulders 
And I, was so young, 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey 

I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka Break her off somethin' proper 
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle 
(Every time you kiss me, like some whiskey) Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom Pérignon, she the fine wine Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off my heart 
 Leaves are fallin', it's September (woah)
The night came in and made her shiver 
I told her she could have my jacket  Wrapped it tight around her shoulders 
And I was so young (so young)
'Til she kissed me (yeah)
Like a whiskey (yeah)
And I was so young (so young)
'Til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey"

My man
See this one goes out to all the lovers 
Lovers, lovers that is
Who spend their nights and days undercovers 
Girl the sun could burn out, but you'll still shine
Aww yeah

No, don't ask me if I love you
'Cause I'm sure as the night is long
And don't ask me if I need you
'Cause I'm sure that the time will come

Oh, oh
Hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand 
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again 

Oh-oh-oh ay
Oh-oh-oh ay

No I do oh-oh ay
Oh-oh-oh ay

No don't ask me if I love you
'Cause I'm sure
As the day is gone
And don't ask me if I stay true
When you know you're the only one

Ya
Kiss you, kiss you, kiss you
Hug ya, hug ya, hug ya
Look into your eyes
And I see the ocean 
I ain't got no wings 
But you got me floating on a cloud  Looking down, it's a moment  Champagne flutes, everybody toasting Heartbeat fast on this roller coaster
Love you up and down spin you and round 
Can you hear me now?

Oh, oh
Hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand 
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

They seem to stay the same
They wear different clothes
But play the same games 

Many different ways
To say the same thing  Searching for the right words
The ones that would make you stay
 Exchanging the way things were
For they way that they should be
Yeah
And choosing theses words 
Is saying to her
The things that she never heard
But always deserved

I figured what it is all about 
It's you that I could never live without 
Your everything,
The air that I breathe  Stupid not to know it all along 
And everything I ever did was wrong  Sadly it's too late for sorry 

Oh I'm not even really sure
Who made this mess
And who threw what punch 
But I could not care less
All I know is that I'm here
And you are not, oh
Once I put this wasted pride aside 
Nothing's all I got, oh
 Exchanging the way things were
For they way that they should be, yeah

And choosing theses words 
Is saying to her
The things that she never heard
But always deserved

I figured what it is all about 
It's you that I could never live without 
Your everything 
The air that I breathe  Stupid not to know it all along 
And everything I ever did was wrong  Sadly it's too late for sorry 

Oh Somebody make it stop
Yeah
And pick me up
And just dust me off, oh
The rainy day flood 
Will drowned all this love Trapped at the bottom now Please dig me up

I figured what it is all about 
It's you that I could never live without 
Your everything
