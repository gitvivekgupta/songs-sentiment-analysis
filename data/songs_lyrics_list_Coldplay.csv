The say people go
This particular diamond was extra special

And I should but I can't let you go
But when I'm cold, I'm cold
Yeah, when I'm cold
Cold
There’s a light that you give me when I’m in shadow 
There’s a feeling within me, an everglow 

Like brothers in blood, or sisters who ride
Yeah we swore on that night we’d be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And I’m gonna miss you, I know

But when I’m cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you’re with me and the way you will show
And you’re with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling, this everglow 

What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because, I live for this feeling, this everglow 

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow"

God is, God don't praise me because I be Joe Fraiser 
God don't give nothin' 'bout Joe Fraiser 
God don't care nothin' about England or America as far as
Your wealth is all his
He wants to know how do we treat each other, how do we help each other 
So, I'm gonna dedicate my life to using my name and popularity to helping charities Helping people, unite with people bring people bombing each other because of religious beliefs
We need somebody in the world to help us all make peace

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come
A bigger one
And you'll be lost

Up and up
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field

See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough 
See a bird soaring high above the flood 
It’s in your blood 
It’s in your blood  Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying  Sitting with the poison takes away the pain

Up and up and up
 Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon 
Up and up
Up and up
See the forest staring at every seed Angels in the marble waiting to be freed 
Just need love
Just need love
When the going is rough, saying

I know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow

I'm okay, I've seen the lighter side of life
I'm alright I feel good
So ill go, ill try to start moving

But I've got to get going, so much that I wanted to do
But I wake up smiling 

And this could be my last chance 
Of saving my innocence 
And this could be my last chance 
No more keeping my feet on the ground

And I move, and I wake up smiling

And this could be my last chance 
Of saving my innocence

No more keeping my feet on the ground 

And there's nothing to keep them Nothing to keep them down
And there's nothing to keep them
There's nothing to keep them down."

When you have a question, answers will come Running and hiding, take and dividing You've got your secrets, I've only got a sleeping sun
 Sleeping sun Singing Ooh, ooh, ohh, ohh
Ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh

And you, as I saw, a piece in a jigsaw Run up and around it and jump up real tall
Run round the houses north and the south is
You've got your answers, we've only got a sleeping sun
 Sleeping sun Singing Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh

How to avoid defeat, when truth and fiction meet
Why nothing even turns out how you planned 
 These are things that I don't understand 
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand 

I can't, and I can't decide 
Wrong, all my wrong from right 
Day, all my day for night 
Or dark, all my dark for light 
I live, but I love this life"

Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah! No we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go let me go
Will not let you go let me go (never)
Never let you go let me go
Never let me go ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

When the future's architecture 
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December 
When the banks became cathedrals 
And the fog Became God
 Priests clutched onto bibles  Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And the cross was held aloft 

Bury me in armor 
When I'm dead and hit the ground 
My nerves are poles that unfroze 

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier 
Who the captain of some sinking ship Would stow 
Far below 

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to violet hill There we sat in snow
All the time she was silent and still 

So if you love me
Won't you let me know?

If you love me
Won't you let me know?"

For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string

I was held from the rooftop, then they let go

As I crawl to the ground

If no one ever hears? Every time I try to pull you close 
You disappear

Just a whisper in a path of smoke 
A secret that nobody knows
No one will ever hear

Oh, maybe I'm a ghost  Specter on a roller coast Fallen out of rose Something people fear

Yeah!

Up and up, up and up

Down upon a canvas, working with a wheel  Waiting for a chance to pick your orange peel
Up and up, up and up

See a performer, a diamond in the rough 
See a bird soaring high above the flood 
It's in your blood, it's in your blood 
 Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying  Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up
 Saying we’re gonna get it, get it together 
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flow

We’re gonna get it, get it together 
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and flow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up
 Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon 
Up and up, up and up

How can people suffer, how can people part?
How can people struggle
How can people break your heart  Break your heart?

Yes I wanna go, yes I wanna feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to heal it up, heal it up

See the forest staring at every seed Angels in the marble waiting to be freed 
Just need love, just need love
When the going is rough, saying 

We’re gonna get it, get it together 
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow

We’re gonna get it, get it together and go

'Cause you can say what is, or fight for it Close your mind and take the risk
You can say, smile and clench your fist
And see each other as a gift

We’re gonna get it, get it together 
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flow

I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and flow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

When you’re in pain, when you think you’ve had enough 
Don’t ever give up
Don’t ever give up"
