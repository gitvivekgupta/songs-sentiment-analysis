Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me babe Wanna show you how much, I really care about yo heart I wanna show ya how much, I hate being apart
Show ya, show ya, show ya til you're through with me
I wanna keep it how it is, so you can never say how it used to be
 Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch  Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh) Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh) Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah Tonight it's going down
I'll be rockin' on my babe rockin' rockin' on my babe
Swirlin' on you babe swirlin' swirlin on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body Promise not to tell nobody 'cause
It's bout to go down

You'll never need two, 'cause I will be your number 1
Them other chicks are superficial But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backin' this thing back
Pop poppin' this thing back
Drop drop drop dropping this thing back
This is for the time, you gave me flowers For the world, that is ours
For the mulah, for the power of love
I know I won't never ever eh-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough A woman in the street and the freak in the you know what
Sit back sit back it's the pre game show Daddy you know what's up
 Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch  Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh) Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh) Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah Tonight it's going down
I'll be rockin' on my babe rockin' rockin' on my babe
Swirlin' on you babe swirlin' swirlin on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body Promise not to tell nobody 'cause
It's bout to go down

I'mma take this time
To show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you all I need
No money can emphasize or describe The love that's in between the lines Boy look into my eyes While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rockin' on you babe
Rockin' rockin' on you babe
Swirlin' on you babe
In my mind all I can think about
Is a frame for our future And the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last
 Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh) Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh) Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah Tonight it's going down
I'll be rockin' on my babe rockin' rockin' on my babe
Swirlin' on you babe swirlin' swirlin on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body Promise not to tell nobody 'cause
It's bout to go down"

 Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff (Yes)
If I bought it, please don't touch 
And keep talkin' that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And, it's my name that's on that Jag,
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab
 Standing in the front yard, telling me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted 

You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute, Matter fact, he'll be here in a minute 

You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow 
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable 

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops! I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for? Because you was untrue, rollin her round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys Hurry up before your taxi leaves 
 Standing in the front yard, telling me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted 

You must not know 'bout it, you must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute, Matter fact, he'll be here in a minute 

You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I will have another you by tomorrow 
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable (irreplaceable)

So since I'm not your everything,
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you
I won't lose a wink of sleep 
'Cause the truth of the matter is, replacing you is so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
 Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left

If you ain't getting money, then you ain't got nothing for me
Tell me something (tell me something) Where your boss at? (where your boss at?) Where my ladies up in there that like to talk back? (that like to talk back)

This is a stick up, stick up
I need them bags of that money 
A stick up, stick up
You see them; ask 'em where that money 
All my ladies get it up
I see you, I do the same
Take it to another level
No passengers on my plane

Once upon a time there was a mountain That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers 
The forest was also inhabited By a small group of people called the lizards The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility 
Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks And the trees and the rivers But most importantly, they thanked Icculus
 Icculus lived at the top of the mountain Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed Because they had the Helping Friendly Book Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge Inherent in the universe And had enabled the Lizards To exist in harmony with nature for years 
And so they lived Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge His name was Wilson And he quickly became intrigued By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider Were happy to oblige  Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well
 Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone Wilson explained that he had hidden the book Knowing that the Lizards had become Dependent on it for survival 
He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge He cut down the trees and built a city Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle And locked in the highest tower of the castle

With his kisses  Fever when he holds me tight 
 Fever 
I'm his Mrs.
And, daddy, won't you treat him right?

Now that you've listened to my story 
Here's the point that I have made Chicks were born to give ya fever 
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade 

They give ya fever 
When ya kiss 'em
And fever if you live and learn  Fever till you sizzle

They were not long enough 
All of our conversations 
All of your sweet pages
They're never long enough 

When it's time for me to leave 
It's so hard to say goodbye 
I never want to say goodbye 
I never ever want to say goodbye 

One day we'll make love Finally I'll be yours 
Only you, only you 
I could love you
It's too late 
I already love you

I wanted more than just a man
I needed a friend  Someone I can talk to someone who really listens
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin 

It was the summertime 
When we fell in love ot was the summertime  Heaven shined on us it was the summertime 
Baby there is nothing like the summertime  Summertime 

Now it's been a year and were closer 
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside for me
And now you are my prize 
Want to grow old witcha 
And fill our house with your pictures 
Have a son for you
A little girl for me Together we'll raise a family 

Baby you're more than just a man
You are my best friend  Someone I can talk to someone who really listens
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin

I can't believe I believed, everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think, she was from your past Silly of me to dream of, one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong 

I can't believe I fell for four years, and I'm smarter than that
So young and naive to believe that with me, you're a changed man Foolish of me to compete, when you cheat with loose women

But I lucked out to make it through (after all the rain you see the sun come out again)

See that's why you in my life right now, smile right now..
I'm sorry, boo... I'm sorry..
Just you know, that you got mature... shoot..
Ya'll ladies keep your mouth shut right now
'Cause ya'll don't know what y'all talking about
This between me and her, that's my word, she just upset 

Changes... we all go through changes
Arguments, disagreements, and to some it's dangerous 
But your mind and your heart's clogged with all your pain and
But a bond that we was holding, what made us famous 

Hey miss, beautiful mami with tears of stone 
Stop cryin', come talk to Tone
Tell me everything that's goin' wrong like your needs and doubts 
My reason for coming in late, I need cheese and sprouts 

So I could continue to hold down the foundation 
It's pitiful how you could charge me with violations  Patience is the key, fuck the frustrations 
We act off our emotions and we start hatin'

And that leads to stress, problems and weight loss Total baldness, broke homes come from negative forces
Baby be cautious, you got to call the cops to get me out
When it come, babe, I'm goin' all out

Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark Wanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample  Dangerous games we played on the third rail
 Fiend for the summer breeze Hopped out the Lee's Dungrares 
Into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports 
To take us away from here, but I cut too much

Me and B, she about to sting  Stand back

Baby, seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile 
It's like I breathe you; helplessly I reminisce 
Don't want to compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control 
Your sexiness is so appealing 
I can't let it go
Oh

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute 
Baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute 
Baby, I swear it's deja vu
 Seeing things that I know can't be
Am I dreaming? When I saw you walking past me Almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away Feels like I'm losing it

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control 
Your sexiness is so appealing 
I can't let it go, oh

And I don't want no substitute

Yes, Hova's flow so unusual 
Baby girl, you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro'
'Cause you gon' need help tryin' to study my bounce 
Flow, blow--what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough--po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go; my dough keep the scales tipping
Like four-fours, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argument 
I don't make the list; don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory 
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No deja vu, just me and my, oh

Baby, I can't go anywhere  Without thinking that you're there  Seems like you're everywhere, it's true Gotta be having deja vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane; I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having deja vu?

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control 
Your sexiness is so appealing 
I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute 
Baby, I swear it's deja vu

I be the d-boy, who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call all-the-booze Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lauraine Schwartz, oughta do
It's big balling baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags, and fly pads, and  Rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors you on the verge 
Of a new merge, 'cause that rock on ya finger, is like a Tumor 
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse 
It's humorous, to me they watching and we just yachting off the island hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso! Oh baby, you ever seen Saturn? 
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level not eye level 
My bezel, courtesy of Audemars 
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you

Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars Picture your life elevating with me
Make you my project celebrity I keep your name hot in them streets 
That little glimpse of light  Makes that diamond really shine 
And you already is a star Unless your flawless 
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you Switch your neck ties to purple labels  Upgrade you, I can (up), can I (up) let me upgrade you
Partner, let me upgrade you

Partner, let me upgrade you
Flip a new page Introduce you to some new things, and upgrade you
I can (up), can I (up), let me, upgrade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you
 Audemars Piguet watch, dimples in ya necktie  Hermes briefcase, Cartier tie clips 
Silk-lined blazers, diamond creamed facials 
VVS, six-star pent suites 
Partner, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partner, partner, let me, upgrade you, grade you
Let me, let me, let me, upgrade you, grade you

Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you, you?
I know you're probably thinking ""what's up with B?""
I been crying for too long what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm crying can't stop crying, can't stop crying 
You could have told me that you wasn't happy 
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes 
And see she's had half of me (you lie)
How could you lie?(you lie)"

It's like I breathe you; helplessly I reminisce

That's a no-go; my dough keep the scales tipping
Like four-fours, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argument 
I don't make the list; don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory 
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No deja vu, just me and my, oh

Baby, I can't go anywhere  Without thinking that you're there  Seems like you're everywhere, it's true Gotta be having deja vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane; I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having deja vu?

You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But, baby, that was a long time ago

On top of you not calling me back
You see, I bet you think it's all on track And you actin' like it's all of dat

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition Telling me you a dog? People told me 'bout the flames 
I couldn't see through the smoke 
When I need answers 
Accusations, what you mean you gon' choke?

You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spendin' yo' dough 
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture-perfect movie everyone would have saw

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong 
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it, and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

He so done, workin' 'em both
She gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call--time to ring the alarm 
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show, and I won't let you go
All is been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

They call shots, I call audibles  Jacob the jeweler, Bubbles, Loraine Schwartz sorta dude
It's big ballin', baby, when I'm courtin' you
I'm talking spa bags and fly pads and rooms at the Bloomberg 
And rumors you on the verge of a new marriage 
'Cause that rock on your finger's like a tumor 
You can't fit your hand in your new purse 
It's humorous to me; they watchin' and we just yachtin' Island hoppin' off the Omafi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn 
No, not the car, but everywhere we are?
You sure to see stars 
This is high-level, not eye-level

I'll order yours tomorrow; now look at the time I saved ya
Mama, let me upgrade ya

Just when you think you had it all
Big ends, car notes, collectin' cars Picture your life elevated with me
Make you my project celebrity
I'll keep your name hot in them streets 

It's that little glimpse of light 
That makes the diamond really shine 
And you already is a star
But unless you're flawless 
Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

Silk line blazers  Diamond cream facials  VVS cuff links 
Six star pimp suites

Partner, partner, let me upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me upgrade ya, grade ya

I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission 
'Cause with every hug and kiss you're snatching every bit of strength 
That I'm goin' need to fight off the inevitable 
And it's a heartbreaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control 

You're just like poison  Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison 
And I just don't get it, how can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do, it's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison 
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

You ain't right, take me high
Then that high it subsides and my body flat-lines
Then you come to revive; wait, wait, wait, I'm alive 
But how long will it last? Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis? Will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down

Kiss me one more time before I die

It's just not my body (no)
It's my mind, you don't know how many times I told myself this can't do (can't do)
And that I don't need you (no, I don't need you)
It's so unfair that I find myself right back in your care
And what's good is that when you're not always there
You know that for my health, my health 
You're just like poison (whoa, whoa, whoa)
You're just like poison (whoa, whoa, whoa)

You're just like poison  Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison 
And I just don't get it, how can something so deadly feel so right?

'Cause the cure is found in you, I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison 
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Baby, kiss me one more time

You're just like poison  Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time

And I just don't get it, how can something so deadly feel so right?

What can bring me back to life?

A simple word, a gesture Someone to say you're beautiful Come find this buried treasure Rainbows lead to a pot of gold

No, no, no broken-hearted girl

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooo
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't got to be afraid; my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away, away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't wanna be without you, baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, baby
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no

I don't want a broken heart
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl"

I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on Notice you the type, that like to keep them on a leash though

When you're in them big meetings for the mills, that's a good look

Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo

I'll be the help, whenever you need me

I'm talking spy bags, and fly pads, and  Rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors you on the verge 
Of a new merge, 'cause that rock on ya finger, is like a Tumor 
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse 
It's humorous, to me they watching and we just yachting off the island hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso! Oh baby, you ever seen Saturn? 
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level not eye level 
My bezel, courtesy of Audemars 
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you

Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars Picture your life elevating with me
Make you my project celebrity I keep your name hot in them streets 
That little glimpse of light  Makes that diamond really shine 
And you already is a star Unless your flawless 
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

To show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you all I need
No money can emphasize or describe 
The love that's in between the lines 
Boy look into my eyes While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rockin' on you babe
Rockin' rockin' on you babe
Swirlin' on you babe
In my mind all I can think about 
Is a frame for our future 
And the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

High like treble, pumping on them mids
Ya man ain't never seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rollin' off your tongue 
'Cause when you want a smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker 
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

I don't need you seeing 'Yonce on her knees 
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged
Oh he so horny, yeah he want to fuck
He bucked all my buttons, he ripped my blouse 
He Monica Lewinski'd all on my gown

Oh there daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel 
Oh baby, baby we slow it down
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up

The kind of girl you like, girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like
Is right here with me
 Driver roll up the partition fast Driver roll up the partition fast
Over there, I swear I saw them cameras flash Handprints and footprints on my glass  Handprints and good grips all on my ass Private show with the music blasting
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty 
Red wine drip, talk that trash  Chauffer eavesdropping trying not to crash 

Oh there daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel 
Oh baby, baby we slow it down
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club

We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls 
""You can have ambition 
But not too much
You should aim to be successful 
But not too successful  Otherwise you will threaten the man"" Because I am female 
I am expected to aspire to marriage 
I am expected to make my life choices  Always keeping in mind that Marriage is the most important 
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage 
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to each other as competitors 
Not for jobs or for accomplishments  Which I think can be a good thing 
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social 
Political, and economic equality of the sexes

I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander

Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest 
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cuz all the shit I hear is boring 
All the shit I do is boring 
All these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels I'm touring

If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous  Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself Baby girl you can't survive like this

Take it one step further Freakum dress out my closet 'Yonce fillin' out this skirt I look damn good I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy you been hanging out tonight I'm staying out 'til tomorrow Been dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow I ran into my ex
Said what up to his bestest Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas Don't be jealous 
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous  Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes Do the type of things that I'll never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself Baby girl you can't survive like this no

And I hate you for your lies and your covers And I hate us for making good love to each other And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing That ain't nothing I'm just jealous I'm just human Don't judge me

Ain't no doctor or therapeutic that can take the pain away
The pain's inside And nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul that needs surgery
It's my soul that needs surgery Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
And you break when the paper signs you in the dark
You left a shattered mirror
And the shards of a beautiful girl
 Pretty hurts Shine the light on whatever's worse Perfection is the disease of a nation Pretty hurts Shine the light on whatever's worse Tryna fix something But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery 
When you're alone all by yourself And you're lying in your bed Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself It's just a way to masquerade The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself Are you happy with yourself Yes"

And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart""
 Until you had enough and you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins Dust yourself off and you love again You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

All night long, sweet love all night long Sweet love all night long Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other 
We together, I remember  Sweet love all night long

Our love was stronger than your pride  Beyond your darkness, I'm your light 
Oh, if you get deep, you touch my mind
If you get deep, you touch my mind Baptize your tears and dry your eyes Baptize your tears and dry your eyes

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again 
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long Sweet love all night long Sweet love all night long Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other 
We together, I remember  Sweet love all night long

They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections 
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Oh nothing real can be threatened 
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption 
And my torturer became a remedy 

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again 
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long Sweet love all night long Sweet love all night long Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other 
We together, I remember  Sweet love all night long

How I missed you, my love"

Daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me
Oh, oh, oh Daddy made me dance 
And daddy held my hand
And daddy liked his whisky with his tea
And we rode motorcycles 
Blackjack, classic vinyl Tough girl is what I had to be

He said take care of your mother  Watch out for your sister 
Oh, and that's when he gave to me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot 
Oh, my daddy said shoot 
With his right hand on his rifle 
He swore it on the bible 
My daddy said shoot 
Oh, my daddy said shoot 
He held in his arms
And he taught me to be strong 
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around 
Oh, my daddy said shoot 
Oh, my daddy said shoot 
 Daddy made me fight 
It wasn't always right
But he said girl it's your second amendment, oh, oh, oh
He always played it cool
But daddy was no fool
And right before he died he said remember 

He said take care of your mother  Watch out for your sister 
And that's when daddy looked at me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot 
Oh, my daddy said shoot 
With his right hand on his rifle 
He swore it on the bible 
My daddy said shoot 
Oh, my daddy said shoot 
He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong 
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around 
Oh, my daddy said shoot 
Oh, my daddy said shoot 

My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you Cause when trouble comes in town
And men like me come around 
Oh, my daddy said shoot 
Oh, my daddy said shoot  Cause when trouble comes to town
And men like me come around 
Oh, my daddy said shoot 
Oh, my daddy said shoot"

Tell the storm I'm new
I'm a wall, come and march on the regular  Painting white flags blue

Lord forgive me, I've been running  Running blind in truth 
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

I'm telling these tears, go and fall away, fall away
May the last one burn into flames 
 Freedom  Freedom 
I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose 
Singin', freedom  Freedom  Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself 
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running 
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves 

I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters 
Tell the tide, ""Don't move""
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders 
Call me bulletproof 

Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth 
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves 

Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice  Channel nine news tell me I'm movin' backwards  Eight blocks left, death is around the corner  Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona 
Six headlights wavin' in my direction 
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession 
Yeah I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts 
Fire hydrants and hazardous  Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me Breathe for me, sing for me Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression 
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs 
And when they carve my name inside the concrete 
I pray it forever reads
 Freedom  Freedom 
I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose 
Singin', freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself 
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running 
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves 

What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? 
Oh father can you hear me?

Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you
 Something don't feel right  Because it ain't right  Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secret, and I'm not too perfect 
To ever feel this worthless 
How did it come down to this? Going through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch 
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately 
I'd rather be crazy 

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you

Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself 
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets  Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets  Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other 
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you

What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Oh it is such a shame 
You let this good love go to waste 
I always keep the top tier, 5 star Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood Holly like a boulevard 

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately 
I'd rather be crazy 

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you

Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, what's up?
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, what's up?
What's up, what's up, what's up"
