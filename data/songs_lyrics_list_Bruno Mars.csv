Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen 

Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
Yeah, a different city every night oh right 
I swear the world better prepare 
For when I'm a billionaire 

Yeah I would have a show like Oprah 
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
Give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Get it, hehe, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah can't forget about me stupid  Everywhere I go Imma have my own theme music

Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night oh right 
I swear the world better prepare 
For when I'm a billionaire 
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire 
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire 

I'll be playing basketball with the President  Dunking on his delegates 
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the five, twenties tens and bens completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket 
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was Eating good sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet 
And put it in the air and sing

I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen 
Oh every time I close my eyes I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night all right 
I swear the world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire 
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire

In hopes you're on

They say
I've gone mad
Yeah
I've gone mad
But they don't know
what I know
 Cause when the
sun goes down
someone's talking back
Yeah
They're talking back

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself Talking to the Moon
Try to get to You
In hopes you're on
